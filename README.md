## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Windows** (due to keyboard library requirements)

### Required Dependencies
```
tkinter (usually included with Python)
pyaudio
wave (built-in)
whisper
numpy
pyperclip
keyboard
openai
pystray
Pillow
python-dotenv (optional, for .env file support)
```

### API Setup (Optional)
- OpenAI API key for cloud transcription features
- Set as `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable or in `.env` file

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd whisper_local
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up API key (for cloud features):**
   
   Option A - Environment variable:
   ```bash
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```
   
   Option B - Create .env file:
   ```bash
   echo OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here > .env
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will show a loading screen while initializing components, then display the main window. You can minimize it to system tray by closing the window.

### Legacy Support
The original `audio.py` file is still available but deprecated. Use `app.py` for the new modular architecture.

### Basic Workflow
1. **Select Model**: Choose your preferred transcription method from the dropdown
2. **Record**: Press `*` to start recording, press `*` again to stop
3. **Wait**: The app will process and transcribe your audio
4. **Auto-paste**: Transcribed text is automatically pasted to your active window

### Keyboard Controls
- **Start/Stop Recording**: Press `*` (works globally in any application)
- **Cancel Operation**: Press `-` to stop recording or cancel transcription
- **Disable Program**: Press `Ctrl+Alt+*` to temporarily disable all functionality

### Model Selection
- **Local Whisper**: Runs entirely offline, good accuracy, ~2-5 second processing time
- **API: Whisper**: Standard OpenAI Whisper via API, requires internet
- **API: GPT-4o Transcribe**: Highest accuracy, premium model, requires API key
- **API: GPT-4o Mini Transcribe**: Fast and cost-effective, requires API key

### System Tray
- **Right-click tray icon**: Show/hide window or exit application
- **Closing main window**: Sends app to system tray (doesn't exit)

### Configuration

#### Audio Settings
The application uses these optimized audio settings:
- **Sample Rate**: 44,100 Hz
- **Channels**: Mono (1 channel)
- **Format**: 16-bit PCM
- **Chunk Size**: 1024 frames
- **Post-roll Buffer**: 1.2 seconds of additional recording

#### File Size Management
- **Maximum File Size**: 23MB before automatic splitting
- **Split Detection**: Uses silence detection with 0.5-second minimum silence
- **Chunk Overlap**: 2-second overlap between chunks to prevent word cutoffs
- **Minimum Chunk Duration**: 30 seconds per chunk

#### Waveform Styles
- **Available Styles**: 5 distinct visualization themes
- **Live Preview**: Real-time style preview in selection dialog
- **Persistent Selection**: Remembers your chosen style across sessions
- **Customizable Colors**: Each style has configurable color schemes

#### Settings Files
- **Main Settings**: `audio_recorder_settings.json` (persistent configuration)
- **Log File**: `audio_recorder.log` (application events and errors)
- **Temporary Files**: `recorded_audio.wav` (current recording, overwritten each time)
- **Environment**: `.env` file support for API keys and configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No API key found" error:**
- Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in environment variables or `.env` file
- API key is only required for cloud transcription options
- Check that the key has proper permissions for your selected API model

**Keyboard shortcuts not working:**
- Run the application as administrator if needed
- Check if the program is disabled (press `Ctrl+Alt+*` to re-enable)
- Verify hotkey settings haven't been changed in the hotkey configuration dialog

**Recording fails:**
- Check microphone permissions in Windows settings
- Ensure no other applications are exclusively using the microphone
- Review `audio_recorder.log` for detailed error information
- Try restarting the application if audio device enumeration fails

**Application won't start:**
- Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version is 3.8 or higher
- Ensure PyAudio can access your audio devices
- Check for missing Visual C++ redistributables on Windows

**Waveform overlay not appearing:**
- Verify the overlay is enabled in settings
- Check if it's positioned off-screen (resets to cursor position on next use)
- Ensure your graphics drivers support the required transparency features

**Large file transcription issues:**
- Files over 23MB are automatically split using silence detection
- Ensure sufficient disk space for temporary chunk files
- Check `audio_recorder.log` for splitting progress and any errors

### Performance Notes
- **First Local Run**: Whisper model download (~150MB) may take a few minutes depending on internet speed
- **Local vs API**: Local processing takes 2-5 seconds, API is usually faster but requires internet
- **Memory Usage**: Local Whisper model uses ~500MB RAM when loaded
- **Audio Splitting**: Large files may take additional time for silence analysis and chunk processing
- **Waveform Styles**: More complex styles (Particle, Retro) may use slightly more CPU during recording

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter with ttk components
- **Audio Processing**: PyAudio for capture, Wave for file handling
- **Speech Recognition**: OpenAI Whisper (local) or OpenAI API (cloud)
- **System Integration**: Keyboard hooks, clipboard operations, system tray
- **Concurrency**: ThreadPoolExecutor for background tasks
- **Configuration**: Centralized config management with dataclasses
- **Testing**: Unit tests with mocking for hardware dependencies

### Security & Privacy
- **Local Mode**: Audio never leaves your computer
- **API Mode**: Audio is sent to OpenAI servers for processing
- **No Data Storage**: Recordings are temporarily saved and overwritten
- **Logging**: Only application events are logged, not audio content
